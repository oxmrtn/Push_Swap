# PUSH SWAP

Hello 👋

Here is my implementation of 42 project PUSH_SWAP 🖥️

This is the first time we consider complexity of an algorithm.
We have to sort a stack using only limited operations.

After some research, i choose to use an optimised insert sort.

With this aproach I easily got 125/100 ✅
